# Merch It
> A helper application that converts the SquareSpace JSON feed into one that is parsable by the Google Merchant Center.

This app is a work in progress and is likely to not function entirely.

#Inspiration
I was inspired to create this project after reading the comments in the Squarespace post [http://answers.squarespace.com/questions/28416/google-merchant-data-feed-google-shopping].

# Codebase 
This app is built on [nodejs](http://nodejs.org).

# Framework
This is a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application.
